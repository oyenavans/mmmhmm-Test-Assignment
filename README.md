## 1.0 List of Bugs found on the App
1. The first page on the design shows the list of books that are available on the application but on the prototype, its a blank page with just "Bookshelf header" and a button to "Add book". Although this is not a bug

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113165921/189499114-7058f70c-a334-4241-ba28-68dc8cea1f69.png)

-->**Recommendation**
Showing just a blank page with just the bookshelf header, is not a good User experience. It would be nice to see list of books available in the bookshelf, this would even prompt the user to add his own books to it 

2. The close button "X" is not on the right position. It is beneath the "Add new book" . the first image is how it was designed on the design file and the second image is how it is on the prototype

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113165921/189502801-442e6ff9-b722-4721-a934-53ab17076c4c.png)

-->**Recommendation**
 The close button icon should be positioned at the far end on the top right hand side of the page and it should not be this bold as it is 

3. The font size used for the header is too big. the image below shows how it looks like at 100% screen 
4. 

5. The close button which is the "X" icon is not working. when i click on the icon, it is expected to close the "Add new book" page and redirect me back to the previous page

-->**Recommendation**
The purpose of the "X" icon is to close a page, but if there can be a back icon then it would be more appropriate, cause the back icon would redirect the user to the previous page

6. The "X" icon style and shade of grey is different with what is on the design; the first picture is what is on the design

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113165921/189500869-545da70d-192f-4d53-9202-f7f6b6353dd2.png)

-->**Recommendation**
The "X" icon in red color would look better on the page. 

7. On the first page of the prototype, the "Add new" button color is not the same shade of green with what is on the design file.  The one on the design file is slightly darker . the first image is from the design file

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113165921/189502110-47390130-39de-43c1-b7d6-82db002f0310.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113165921/189502119-902eb6a6-f076-445d-beb2-99c52b820a39.png)

-->**Recommendation**
The designers and the developers should be aligned with the color codes used on the designs so as to get the accurate shade 

8. The First page  with the "Add book" is not mobile responsive

9. The "Add new book" page is also not mobile responsive

-->**Recommendation**
The application should be made responsive for all screens. Most people find it easy and quick to read books from their phones than making use of a laptop. Also the number of people that have a smart phone is higher than that of laptop and for those that have both, it is likely that majority would sought out reading from their phones 

10. The "Description" on the design file is in bold font compare to what is on the application
11. The input field  box for the Description is not the same size with what is on the design file

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113165921/189501015-6fc5515f-d8d7-4235-87b0-faa8e8ea651f.png)

-->**Recommendation**:
There can be an inside scroll bar in the description field when the user can input full details of the description without being mindful of the little space.
Or , there can be a limit to the text a user can type so as we can have a coordinated and uniform description on all other books that would be added

12. The second screen on the design file which is the "Add a new book" page, the last button beneath all the input field was written as "Save" but on the prototype it is writen as "Add book"

-->**Recommendation** :
The "Add book" on the prototype page gives a better approach to what the user is about doing

13. The edges on the "Save" button is more curved than that on "Add book" button

-->**Recommendation**: 
The structure of the "Save button" looks more friendly and continous, it is also in line with the current trend in design 

14. There is a border within the walls of the "Add book" button

-->**Recommendation**:
Remove any border found in any button and make it as seen on the design file

15. The button color shade is slightly different

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113165921/189502746-b60e0e32-38a6-4687-b994-5a5b939d565e.png)

16. The header text is not align with the structures of the input fields as it is on the design file. the first image is whats is on the design file and the second is what is on the prototype

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113165921/189504107-2cc8901e-a678-4151-992c-c1170718eca6.png)

-->**Recommendation**
The first letter on the text header should be aligned with the rest of the structures as indicated on the design file. this makes the application looks better.

17. I was able to click on the Add button without the Book Title

-->**Recommendation**
When adding a book without the title, there should be a red error text underneath the input field so that the user can be prompted to enter the title and the "Add book" button should not be clickable

18. I was able Add bool without the Author name,

-->**Recommendation:**
When adding a book without the name of the author, there should be a red error text underneath the input field so that the user can be prompted to enter the Auhor's name and the "Add book" button should not be clickable

19. I was able to Add book without the Description,

-->**Recommendation:**
When adding a book without the inputing the Description, there should be a red error text underneath the input field so that the user can be prompted to enter the Description and the "Add book" button should not be clickable

20. I was able to Add book without the image url,

-->**Recommendation**:
When adding a book without the image url, there should be a red error text underneath the input field so that the user can be prompted to enter the image url and the "Add book" button should not be clickable. It would be easier to upload the cover image of the book and also faster for the user since its not every one that would understand or know how to get the image url

21. When the user clicks on the "Add book" button after filling up the all fields, the page reloads and all fields are cleared. i.e. the button acts as a refresh button.

-->**Recommendation**:
After filling up the fields to add book, and the user clicks on "Add book", a pop up success page should be displayed letting the user know that the book was added successfully, and the user should be routed to the list of books recently addded in the bookshelf

22. I was able to add book without any details (with empty fields)

-->**Recommendation**:
Users should not be able to add books with empty fields. The "Add book" button should not be clickable.

23. **After adding books, i routed back to the first page on the prototype and this are the list of bugs found**
   - The 'Bookshelf" header and "Add book" was not visible
   - The delete icon is not working, i was not able to delete any book that was added
   - Just by clicking on the "Add book" button with empty fields, it saves empty space as book 
   - The image uploaded took the screen of the laptop and did not fill up the field of the book that was uploaded

   *the image above shows how the first page of the prototype is and the image below shows are it should look like*

# 2.0 TEST PLAN

## Introduction

This test plan for the MVP supports the following objectives:
1. To define the the tools to be used throughout the testing process.
2. To communicate to the responsible parties the items to be tested, set expectations
around schedule, and define environmental needs.
3. To define how the tests will be conducted.

## Test Items

The systems to be tested include the frontend platform. These systems should be tested in Chrome 105.0, Microsoft Edge 105.0, and Safari 15.5. The systems should be tested on both a Windows and Mac machine.

## Functional Features To Be Tested

Features to be tested include the following:
- As a user, Adding book to the bookshelf
- As a user, Deleting books already added
- As a User, Editing books already added incase there is a mistake in the details of the book
- As a user, Adding books with black details
- As a user, Adding books without inputing the Title of the book 
- As a user, Adding books without inputing the Author of the book 
- As a user, Adding books without adding the image url of the book 
- 
## Non-Functional features to be Tested
- The Font style
- The strucures/element position, if it is as the design file
- The color code used
- The call to action buttons
- The responsiveness

## Features Not To Be Tested

Adding a book through a mobile device will not be tested. Only desktop web browserfunctionality will be tested. This is because only a web based design was made but for better user exeperience, it should be available for mobile too


## Approach

Tests will be conducted per the documented test cases stored either on google sheet, Testlodge or any other that is being used. The test manager will create test runs for each tester. The tester will execute the tests and mark each case as Pass / Fail / Skip. The tester should leave notes on actual results and any other relevant details when possible.

When tests are marked as Fail, bug reports will be created and the issue logged on Jira/trello or any similar software. 
Once complete, the test manager should review the test run reports and report back to the team accordingly.

## Pass/Fail Criteria
All core functionality of the systems should function as expected and outlined in the individual test cases. There must be no critical defects found and an end user must be able to complete an add book cycle successfully with full information of the book and initiate an edit or delete without any errors. 95% of all test cases
should pass and no failed cases should be crucial to the end­user’s ability to use the application.

## Suspension Criteria
Testing should be paused immediately if either system experiences  failure in any basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) actions.

## Test Deliverables
Upon completion, the test run results will be saved and the test manager should then run a report for all completed tests.

## Testing Tasks
The following activities must be completed:
● Test plan prepared.
● Functional specifications written and delivered to the testing team
● Environment should be ready for testing
● Perform the tests.
● Prepare test summary report.

## Environmental Needs
The test site must be populated with test data like list of books already on the bookshelf.

## Responsibilities
The Test Manager is responsible for facilitating the testing project, coordinating availability and schedule of testers and training them as needed. Each tester should understand the expectations on completion date and level of quality. The Test Manager should also communicate any risks to the team.

## Staffing And Training Needs
Testing should be done by one or more testers. The tester(s) should conduct testing on the system. The testers assigned should have basic knowledge of a bookstore platform.

## Schedule
Testing will take place 3- 4 weeks prior to the launch date. The first round of testing should be completed in 1 week.

## Risks And Contingencies
If the first round of testing is not completed within 1 week, it could delay bug fixes and final testing. If this happens, UAT would be pushed back and eventual affect the launch date. If the testers don’t have a basic understanding the platform, testing could be delayed or not conducted properly.

## Approvals
The test manager and product manager both must agree on completion of the testing project and determine when it’s ready to proceed to the next step
